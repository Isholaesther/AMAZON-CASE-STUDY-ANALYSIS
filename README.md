4. üßπ Data Processing and Cleaning

Removed null and duplicate records.

Converted string formats (e.g., "‚Çπ50,000", "50%") into numeric values.

Created calculated fields:

Discount % = (Actual Price - Discounted Price) / Actual Price

Potential Revenue = Actual Price * Rating Count


Grouped price ranges into logical buckets:

<‚Çπ200, ‚Çπ200‚Äì‚Çπ500, >‚Çπ500


Extracted numerical counts from comma-separated review values where applicable.

7. üîç Observations and Insights

1. Customer Preference Trends:
Most products fall between 4.0 and 4.3 ratings, indicating general satisfaction. High ratings are consistent across categories, but the number of reviews helps gauge true popularity.


2. Dominance of Electronics:
Electronics not only has the highest number of products but also leads in potential revenue, making it the most commercially impactful category.


3. Aggressive Discounting in Home Kit & Computers:
Categories like Home Kit (58%) and Computers (54%) offer significant discounts, possibly to remain competitive. These may also represent seasonal or clearance sales strategies.


4. Majority Low-Priced Products:
Nearly 99% of all products are below ‚Çπ50,000, showing a strong leaning toward affordability. This affects both the discount strategy and revenue margins.


5. Office Products Lead in Rating:
Despite a smaller number of products, Office Products have the highest average rating (4.31), signaling high satisfaction among fewer items.


6. Low Engagement in Some Categories:
Categories like Toys & Games and Health have low review counts and little revenue contribution‚Äîsuggesting either lower interest or marketing gaps.


7. Discount‚ÄìRating Paradox:
Products with the highest discounts don't always have the highest ratings, implying that deep discounts don‚Äôt guarantee quality perception.

8. ‚úÖ Recommendations

Double Down on Electronics: Optimize listing quality, SEO, and promotions to capitalize on its high revenue potential.

Promote Office Products: With high user satisfaction, these can be pushed more via marketing and bundling strategies.

Audit Low-Engagement Categories: Reassess product mix in categories with zero revenue or low review counts.

Target Mid-Rated Products (4.0‚Äì4.3): They dominate the rating distribution and may benefit from minor product or presentation improvements.

Optimize Discount Strategy: Consider data-backed discounting to avoid unnecessary margin cuts where ratings are already high.



---

9. ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

Static Data: Snapshot from a specific time; no real-time or seasonal variation is captured.

Review Data: Stored as text in CSV, so deep sentiment analysis was not performed.

Currency Impact: All pricing is assumed consistent; international currency differences not accounted for.

Platform Bias: Only includes Amazon data; broader eCommerce insights would require multi-platform analysis.
